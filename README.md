# Waveform-Datapoint-Calculator
Simple Python program that creates data points for 4 different wave-forms.

Each waveform is presented as a 256-byte long array. The values represent the value at a point along the waveform and are in binary. There are 4 different wave types, and each can be generated by calling its respective method:

sine_array()
square_array()
triangle_array()
sawtooth_array()

This program was used to create data points for a waveform generator that was implemented in VHDL.
